## Librairies and Tools

- **Vue 3**: Chosen for its reactivity and simplicity in managing component states.
- **TypeScript**: Used for static typing, which improves code robustness and maintainability.
- **Vite**: Selected for its fast build times and excellent development experience.
- **Vue-Chrts**: Utilized for creating beautiful and responsive charts with minimal setup.
- **Vitest**: Used for testing the application components and utilities.
- **TailwindCSS**: Used for styling the application components and utilities.

## Limitations or Known Issues
- **Data Fetching**: The application currently fetches data from a hardcoded API endpoint. This could be made configurable.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented, but it could be more comprehensive.
- **Testing**: Limited unit tests are currently in place; more extensive testing would be beneficial.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Add more interactive features to the charts, such as zooming and panning.
